/*  - The component should invoke the `login` function in `app.js` 
when a user logs in.
  - This login function should set a `username` on `localStorage`. 
  
  You'll need to check local storage to see if a user is logged in.

  - Be sure to force the page to reload when a user logs in 
  so that our component un-mounts and mounts again.*/
